Express Reservation System

This is an Express-based reservation system that allows users to sign up, log in, book rooms, and view user profiles. It utilizes sessions for user authentication and JSON files for storing user, room, and reservation data.

Noted buggy/nonfunctional features:
- Login (for bcrypt only, login using plaintext works)
- Booking
- Seat click interactivity (in room pages)

Start the server locally by running node server.js or npm start on a command prompt in the server.js file's directory, and change the mongoose link to your localhost link.
Access the application in your web browser at https://mco3-ub37.onrender.com/.

To log in, please refer to the user accounts in the users.js file. One admin account is provided.
For dependencies, please see package.json.
